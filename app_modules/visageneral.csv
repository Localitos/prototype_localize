"Other","Citizens of a third country (non-EU/EEA) who would like to work in Germany and are currently still abroad need a visa for work purposes in order to enter the country.  It is important for you to enter with a visa which corresponds to the actual purpose of your stay, as this is the only way to ensure that your visa can be easily extended or changed to a residence title by the competent aliens authority (Ausländerbehörde) in Germany. A visa which has only been issued for a short stay, such as a tourist visa, can as a matter of principle not be used for a long-term stay. In the same way, it does not entitle you to work. You need to apply for your visa in your home country before entering Germany. Please make the application with the German representation abroad that is responsible for the place where you live (Embassy or Consulate-General)","Check the embassy website for updates on documents, fees and processing time
