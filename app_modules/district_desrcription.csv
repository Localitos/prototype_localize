Eppendorf; Eppendorf is an upscale neighborhood close to the Alster, perfect for the upper middle class, well-to-do singles and other higher-income earners. Escpecially popular with young families, sometimes named the district with the highest buggy density. Rents are pricier but the connection with public transport is really good. The district offers countless retail shops, magnificent houses, fancy boutiques and exquisite restaurants. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, the weekly Isestrasse gourmet market is held underneath the railway line.
Winterhude; Winterhude is a classy, well established neighborhood with high rent prices.  It's a great choice for people working in the northern part of Hamburg and also for commuters, as both central train station and the airport can be reached in 10 minutes. Being located right between Stadtpark and Alster, it also offers great possibilities for sports and outdoor activities.
Eimsbüttel; Eimsbüttel is a central district with beautiful old buildings, a high density of green areas and great culture with some alternative spirit. It offers many places with nice bars and cafes, as well as cheaper rents than Winterhude and Eppendorf. Eimsbüttel attracts many young people and families and has a vibrant atmosphere.
Hafencity; The maritime Hafencity is an upcoming district with many contemporary buildings and new constructions. It is home to the famous Elbphilharmonie and the new Hafen City University.  Not only residential buildings were constructed here but also companies moved to this district, as for example Unilever and the SPIEGEL publishing house. Today it still has a strong business focus, but public squares, restaurants and promenades are slowly changing the vibe.  Most suitable for singles and young couples with a high salary.
Neustadt; The Neustadt is composed of various different quarters and very different vibes: From the city center at the Inner Alster with the Town Hall and the adjacent canals to the Portuguese Quarter in the South, close to the Elbe. It offers nice bars and restaurants, not only in the Portuguese Quarter but also in the Gängeviertel. Affordable flats are rare in this area but if you find any, you can profit from both a great connection with public transport and lots of culture and night life around.
St.Pauli; St. Pauli has a worldwide reputation as the ultimate party district - it is famous for the Reeperbahn with its clubs and bars and its red-light district and the stories surrounding its seedy past are legendary. But even though St Pauli boasts more pubs, restaurants and clubs than any other district, it is also a residential area - for all sorts of people who do not mind the 24-hour bustle of the Reeperbahn and its side streets.  A little aside from the bustling Reeperbahn is the Karolinenviertel with many cafés, snack bars and small retail shops as well as find studios and boutiques of local fashion designers.
Ottensen; Ottensen is a rather alternative and hip district in the western part of Hamburg. Home to a mix of families and students as well as a large number of biological food stores and markets. Rents are still affordable, only the public transport connection is not the best but the great atmosphere of the district definitely makes up for it. In terms of cultural institutions, Ottensen offers cultural centre Fabrik, the cinema Zeisekino as well as numerous off-venues in the narrow side streets.
Blankenese; Blankenese might just be the fanciest place you can find in Hamburg. This picturesque district is a former fishermen's and navigators' village on the banks of the Elbe, in the western part of the city.  Old villas and mansions from the 18th and 19th century as well as a large number of parks dominate Blankenese. It is a great option for families but you need to have an above-average salary to even consider this district.
Altona-Altstadt; Altona-Altstadt is one of the most vibrant districts of Hamburg and home to many different people, families and singles, students and workers as well as artists and freelancers. Rents are still affordable but also strongly vary between the different parts of Altona. Its cultural and commercial offering, its central location, the availability of appartments and its neighbourhood atmosphere make Altona one of Hamburg's most popular residential areas.
Sternschanze; Sternschanze, aka the Schanzenviertel is the alternative heart of Hamburg. It is home to the Rote Flora, a cultural centre that has been occupied since 1989 and continues to represent local resistance against the ongoing gentrification of the neighbourhood. But this gentrification is a fact happening, and the district becomes more and more a paradise for hipsters, freelancers and other creatives with rising rent prices.  It still consists of a large variety of people, from students to families and most options for dining out are very affordable. During weekends, the various bars in the Sternschanze already present a great alternative to the entertainment mile of the Reeperbahn.
Harvestehude; Harvestude is probably the most fancy district in central Hamburg with its old villas and mansions in proximity to the Alster. The Grindelviertel close to the university is the more affordable part of this district but generallyyou need to have a considerable salary to afford living in Harvestehude. The southern part, close to the university, has a higher share of students, the rest of Harvestehude is more dominated by families and couples with higher salaries.
Uhlenhorst; Uhlenhorst is a vital, middle class district with affordable rents and space for spending time outside. It is located east of the Alster and is home to singles, couples and families that value the proximity to the city center as well as the cultural offerings. It has numerous bars and restaurants but is far from being as busy and bustling as the Sternschanze, thus good for people who want to live centrally but enjoy the quietness at the same time.
St.Georg; St. George is the direct neighbor to the central train station and a district full of contrasts.  While the area around the main station can hardly be named as a beautiful part of Hamburg, there is also the other part close to the Alster where the rich and famous reside in the Grand Hotels Atlantic Kempinski and Le Royal Meridien. The central street of St. Georg is the Lange Reihe, with all its cafes, pubs and restaurants from noble to rustic and its reign of gays and lesbians. The district has affordable rent and is most suitable for all people that are up for the bustling life and do not need everything to be conventional.
Barmbek-Nord; Barmbek (Nord/Süd) is mainly a residential area with a mixed demographic structure. The district seems to incorporate the different faces of the city and displays them as if under a magnifying glass: while some areas seem rather noisy and hectic, other areas are quiet, green and idyllic - after all, the Stadtpark is right on your doorstep. Rents are very affordable but some parts of this district lack a good connection to the metro system, so watch out when choosing your apartment.

Wilhelmsburg; The port and the Elbe have always played a key role in Wilhelmsburg, which is home to 50,000 people and is thus the most populous district of Hamburg. Located south of the River Elbe, Wilhelmsburg is considered Hamburg's problem child and hope at the same time. While the western part is characterised by industrial and utility buildings, the rural southeast invites you to take a stroll through the countryside.
